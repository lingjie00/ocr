The Walled City

The wall of the city is some five miles in circumference. It has
five gates, each with double portals. Two gates pierce the eastern side;
the other sides have one gate only. Outside the wall stretches a great moat,
across which access to the city is given by massive causeways. Flanking
the causeways on each side are fifty-four divinities resembling war-lords
in stone, huge and terrifying. All five gates are similar. The parapets
of the causeways are of solid stone, carved to represent nine-headed
serpents. The fifty-four divinities grasp the serpents with their hands,
seemingly tq prevent their escape. Above each gate are grouped five
gigantic heads of Buddha, four of them facing the four cardinal points
of the compass, the fifth head, brilliant with gold, holds a central position.
On each side of the gates are elephants, carved in stone.

The walls, about twelve feet in height, are built entirely of cut
stone blocks, set close and firm, with no crevices for weeds to grow in,
and no crenellations. On the battlements sago palms have been planted
at irregular intervals. Let into the wall here and there are casemates.
The inner side of the wall resembles a glacis, more than sixty feet wide,
at the top of which are huge gates, closed at night and swung open in the
morning. Dogs are forbidden entrance, as are criminals whose toes have
been cut off.

The wall forms a perfect square, with a stone tower at each face.
At the (magical) center of the Kingdom (i.e. the central point of the city)
rises a Golden Tower (Bayon) flanked by more than twenty lesser towers
and several hundred stone chambers. On the eastern side is a golden bridge
guarded by two lions of gold, one on each side, with eight golden Buddhas
spaced along the stone chambers. North of the Golden Tower, at a distance
of about two hundred yards, rises the Tower of Bronze (Baphuon), higher
even than the Golden Tower: a truly astonishing spectacle, with more
than ten chambers at its base. A quarter of a mile further north is the
residence of the King. Rising above his private apartments is another
tower of gold. These are the monuments which have caused merchants
from overseas to speak so often of ‘‘Cambodia the rich and noble.”

About two hundred yards beyond the South Gate rises a mighty
stone tower which, it is said, was built in a single night by Lu Pan (a
legendary Chinese artisan). Lu Pan’s tomb (Angkor Wat) is four hundred
yards distant from the South Gate. Two and a half miles in circumference,
it contains several hundred stone rooms.

The Eastern Lake lies some two and a half miles east of the Walled
City. The distance round it is nearly twenty-five miles. At its center
stands a stone tower, with dozens of stone chambers. In it lies a recumbent
bronze Buddha, from whose navel flows a steady stream of water.

The Northern Lake lies one and a quarter miles to the north of
the Walled City. At its centre stands a square tower of gold (Neak Péan)
with several dozen stone rooms. If you are looking for gold lions, gold
Buddhas, bronze elephants, bronze oxen, bronze horses, here is where
you will find them.
